The objective is to identify each of a large number of black-and-white
   rectangular pixel displays as one of the 26 capital letters in the English
   alphabet.  The character images were based on 20 different fonts and each
   letter within these 20 fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of
   20,000 unique stimuli.  Each stimulus was converted into 16 primitive
   numerical attributes (statistical moments and edge counts) which were then
   scaled to fit into a range of integer values from 0 through 15.
